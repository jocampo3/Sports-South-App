# Sports-South-App
This is a simple python program application that takes in user credentials and utilizes Sports South's API call to retrieve order information.  It is still in its BETA production stages, but the plan is to create a fluid GUI that can be used by local FFL companies to track and analyze their purchases from Sports South.
